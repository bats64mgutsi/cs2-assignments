Dear Tutor

First of all, you are beautiful! Secondly I would like to say how sorry I am for not
finishing my assignment. I thought about not submitting at all, but then I remembered that
I need to submit for DP. Time is an as*hole! He gives no f**ks about anyone or anything.

One thing I do promise you though is that this is the first, and last, assignment for this
course I'll do like this. I'll do better next time.

Love
Batandwa :)
